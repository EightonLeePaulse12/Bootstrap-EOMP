                I am Eighton-Lee Antonio Paulse. I am a fun-loving 18-year-old who knows what he wants in his future and has his goals set out infront of him very clearly. I dream of someday becoming a full-stack developer as I have only recently found my creative side. I like to keep a positive energy everywhere I go because I believe positivity can make any day better. I am very motivated in what I do as I want to follow my dreams and become the best version of myself that I can be.

            <p class="paragraphediting">
              I've always dreamt of one day becoming some sort of developer. However, where I really fell in love with coding was with game development. I was still in highschool when this passion started sparking. I tried to study a programming language called LUA to start making my own games but that did not work out due to lack of practise. But what I gained out of that experience was my dream. I dream of becoming a developer of any sort. I absolutely fell in love with writing any type of code and I consider myself quite talented in learning it.

          <p class="paragraphediting">
            School was great. I did my full 5 years of school at Malibu high school from 2018-2022. The subjects that I had were Mathematical Literacy, Computer Applications Technology, Life Sciences and Business Studies. In 2010, I started grade R at Helderkruin Primary School and went on to do my last year of primary school in 2017.  In 2022, I did my matric at Malibu highschool and succeeded to pass with a bachelor's, with that being the highest pass that you can achieve in matric! Malibu Highschool is located in Blue Downs, Eersteriver and is one of the best schools in the area. I also enjoyed school a lot throughout grade 8 to 12.
